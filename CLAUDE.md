# Claude HTML Tool Project Starter

## Project

All project and feature details to be built are stored in PROJECT.MD.

## Project Structure

- All code should exist in a single index.html file.
- All CSS styles should exist inside a single contigious `<style>` tag in the `<head>`.
- All JS code should exist in a single contigious `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.
- No depedencies may be used in the project.

## Code Style

- After all changes are complete, all code should be formatted with using `npm run lint`.

### Javascript

- Write small functions in vanilla javascript.
- Utilize native HTML form functionality where possible.
- Use consistent naming across multiple variables, ie `colorInput`, `handleColorInputClick`, `resetColorInput`, `getColorInputValue`.

### CSS

- Do not use margin, use flexbox and gap instead.
- Write small tailwind-esque utility classes such as `p-4`, `flex`, or `gap-2` only as needed.
- Use CSS vars where appropriate.
- There should be no variables or classes present that aren't directly used in the markup.
- Create a list of CSS vars for common spacing sizes and colors.
- The background of the page should be a solid #222222.
